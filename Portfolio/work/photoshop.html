                        <p>
                        You must select at least one image from the series of
                        images taken during the excursion.
                        The picture need not be one of the ones you have taken yourself.
                        But no pictures from the web.
                  <br>  The image must be processed in Photoshop so that the
                        following is done as a minimum: </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>  Remove an item: Something in the image must be removed and
                        the background (hole in the back) filled in to fit the image.</li>

                  <li>  Add an item: Something that wasn't originally in the image,
                        must be inserted so it looks like it was there from the start. </li>

                  <li>Adjust the lighting conditions of the image or give the image a mood by filter or tint.</li>

                  <li>Cropping and any alignment (vertical/horizontal) of the image.</li>

                  <li>Format and size: the image must be in 4: 3 format and saved so that the size is ≦ 1 M pixel</li>
                </ul>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                      In this picture I have removed, a few people sitting on the edge of the canal.
                      A crane has been removed from the background. And everything soiled like cigarette
                      shutters and such has been removed from the ground in the foreground.
                      And all boats on the right side of the channel have been removed.

                    <br>  Some of the colors have been edited to make them stronger.
                        The contrast between the two sides of the channel has been made very sharp.

              <br><br>  The red bike is both colors edited and lightened
                        up so that's the thing that cathes our eyes.

                  <br>  Also, the background on both sides of the channel has been
                        blurred to re-focus the bike and to protect the identity
                        of the people in the picture.
                  </p>


          <h2 class="projectoverskrift">Teachers Comment</h2>
                        <p>

                          The color correction is most visible in this image and draws a lot of attention to the sky which is almost pixelated in a handful of blue colors.
                    <br>  Otherwise, the picture has a good balance between the
                          very dark right side and the lighter and strong contrast
                          on the left side. The red bike stands strongly focused
                          because the colors are so extreme that it gets most of
                          the attention. The removed elements do not leave many traces
                          of themselves and function properly.
                        <br> <br>
                        Requirements and dimensions complied with.
