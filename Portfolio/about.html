          My name is Sarah, I'm a student at CphBusiness.
          I love traveling, and have a wish of having visited
          every country in the world before I die. And if that's not
          possible then at the very least having visited every continent.
          <br>
          And I am slowly making my way through.

                Throughout the three years of gymnasium I was part of a student
                volunteer group, and ended up as one of the leaders of the group.
                We supported a program called momentum trust that helps farmers I Kenya. <br>
                We made signs to bring focus to the cause, organized sales at the school.
                We also organized a full day where everyone at the school would do some
                work in the name of the cause.
                <br>
                The thing I'm the proudest of with the group was when we organized a full
                on event by our self, with raffles, live music, open mic, and of cause a
                cake sale, it was our biggest event ever, and it went off without a hitch.
